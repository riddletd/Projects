# My goal is to write a program that stores Physical information. I am
# fully aware that the C++ library "Boost" contains such a program,
# but I want to write I library for myself. If I write it myself, it
# will give me good practice in writing cool software programs.

This file will be used as an informal write-up of the ideas I want to
incorporate into this library of code.

Ideas:


Diminsional Analysis

1) Create a library for diminsional constants and analysis
   * It will be used to check for diminsional correctness on both sides
     of the equation.



Types using Units of Measure

1) I want a clean way of storing types with specific units of measure.
   * This will include storing and representing algebraic types, such
     as L/T or km/s.
   * Also, I would like it to prove possibilities such as diminsional
     analysis checks.
   * 



Conversion of Units



Parsing Equations (Physics Calculator)

1) Create a way of inputting an equation with numbers substituting
   variables and producing a correct output with the correct type
   matching the numeric result.
